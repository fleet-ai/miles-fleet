"""GRPO on Fleet v2 tasksets — one launcher, recipes keyed by --model-name.

Follows the miles convention (run_qwen3_dense.py): recipes live in a frozen
_Recipe table; the model-coupled blocks (engine flags, TITO tokenizer family,
chat template) come from the row, the Fleet rollout block is shared.

    python examples/fleet/launch/run_fleet.py \
        --model-name qwen3.8-27b --dataset-dir <dir> --run-id <name>

Rows:
    qwen3.8-27b      vision-capable, FSDP; validated end-to-end with the Fleet
                     connector on text (ade-bench) and GUI (evaluation-
                     benchmark) tasksets (2026-08)
    glm5.3-flash     vision-capable, Megatron; ported verbatim from upstream
                     scripts/run_glm5_3_flash.py (its 6x4/8x4 GB300 shapes
                     re-expressed for 8-GPU nodes as 3x8/4x8). debug_minimal
                     is the only validated mode until budgets are measured.

Deviations from the stock recipes, each with its reason:
- FSDP backend, not Megatron: miles's Megatron qwen3_5 spec is language-only
  (docs: "trains the text path only"); FSDP trains the full HF model
  including the vision towers, with no torch_dist conversion.
- rollout block targets a prepared Fleet JSONL (see ../prepare_dataset.py).
- --use-rollout-routing-replay is OFF: update_sample_from_response assigns
  (not concatenates) routed experts per turn, so multi-turn replay data would
  be wrong-shaped (upstream TODO in generate_endpoint_utils.py).
- --dynamic-sampling-filter-path check_no_aborted: docker-crashed or
  timed-out episodes reject their group instead of training on it.
- prepare() is idempotent (Path.exists) so concurrent jobs share one
  downloaded model under the launch manifest's flock.
